Slider Recipes
==============

I need to control the year start and year end for an interaction, and
year start should always be less than year end.  How to do?

* `a_basic.py` - gets the sliders in place

* `b_update_end.py` - gets the start year right when end year changes

* `c_update_start_and_end.py` - natural extension to get start and end
  right when the other changes, but that doesn't work
